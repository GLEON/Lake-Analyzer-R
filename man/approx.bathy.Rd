\usage{
approx.bathy(zMax, lkeArea, numZ)

approx.bathy(zMax, lkeArea, numZ)
}
\arguments{
\item{zMax}{numeric max depth in meters}

\item{lkeArea}{a sinlge value of the surface area of the lake (in m^2)}

\item{numZ}{integer number of depth layers}

\item{Zmax}{a single value of the maxiumum depth of the lake (in m)}

\item{Zmean}{a single value of the mean depth of the lake (in m)}

\item{depths}{a numeric vector of depths (in m) at which areas are estimated. 
If not specified depths is regularly spaced sequence of values with the interval set by zinterval.}

\item{zinterval}{a sinlge value defining the depth interval at which volumes should be calculated, default is 1 m.}

\item{method}{specifies the method used to estimate depth-area relationship, can be "cone"(default) or "voldev". Method "voldev" requires Zmean. See notes for details.}

\item{lkeArea}{numeric lake area in meters squared.}
}
\value{
a dataframe which defines the lake area for each depth. Columns are depths (m) and Area.at.z (m^2). Area at 0 m should equal the user entered lkeArea.

\description{
Estimates a depth-area curve for a lake using lake surface area, 
maximum depth and mean depth. Two methods for estimating the curve are available;
'cone' assumes the lake is shaped as a cone and requires only surface area and 
maximum depth; "voldev" uses the volume development (Vd) parameter from Håkanson (1981) 
and Johansson et al. (2007). Vd is a dimensionless parameter that describes 
lake basin shape in relation to the volume of cone whose base area and height 
equal the surface area and maximum lake depth, it is estimated as Vd = Zmean/Zmax (Håkanson et al. 2000). 
Method "voldev' requires lake surface area, mean and maximum depth. Depths at 
which the area is estimated can be set by as a numeric vector or as a regularly spaced sequence.

Approximate bathymetry from max depth and lake area.
